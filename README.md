# lasers
FoundryVTT module for lasers, or light-beams that can be reflected using mirrors. This preliminary beta version implements mirrrors and light sources that interact with each other.
Both the mirrors and lightsources are tokens, and they are thus compatible with pushable tokens.

## TODO:
 * Implemnent support for Monks Active tiles, so that light beams can trigger them. As far as today, there is no interaction outside this module of the lightbeams. 
 * The current version use Foundry's default light, or beams that are a slice of a circular (pie slices) light model. Future implementation should introduce paralell beams of light.
 * Colored lights, and the possibility for filters, that change the color of the light along its path.
 * Probably bug-fixing
